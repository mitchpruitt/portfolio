description: "The team behind Ruckus discovered a love of indoor climbing through their daughter, who took an interest in the activity at a young age. Dissatisfied with the lack of quality climbing options in their area, they built a new facility and wanted an identity to match the rambunctious spirit of kids and the kids-at-heart."
