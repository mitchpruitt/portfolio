description: "The team behind Ruckus discovered a love of indoor climbing through their daughter, who took an interest in the activity at a young age. Dissatisfied with the lack of quality climbing options in their area, they built a new facility and wanted an identity to match the rambunctious spirit of kids and the kids-at-heart."

### Setup
Working with the Ruckus team, I developed a moodboard to serve as a visual menu of ideas that we could draw on to develop a brand. Using this board, we created a list of qualities that we wanted to focus on: 
- Dimension – Depth in addition to width and height.
- Primitive forms – Big basic shapes that look like something you can climb on.
- Energy and motion – A playful vibe that echoes the energy of a day of fun.
- Punchy colors – Avoid primary colors and instead opt for more bold natural tones.

### Process work
From there I experimented with cut-up paper shapes to develop type concepts, referenced handholds and volumes from actual climbing suppliers, and modeled shapes in Rhino 3D to ultimately shape a mark that combines a youthful spirit with a bold climbable structure.
In addition to creating the mark, I was also asked to make a small advertisement for use in a local publication announcing the gym's opening.
