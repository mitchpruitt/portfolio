description: "To celebrate the first anniversary of Cycle Labs' founding, I was tasked with creating a commemorative shirt. So much had happened in one year and the business covers so many concepts, it was hard to pin down one central theme. Rather than decide, I was inspired to collect and arrange the best ones instead. Some emblems describe testing strategies we employ, others speak to the company's culture or are inside jokes."
