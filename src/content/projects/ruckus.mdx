description: "The team behind Ruckus discovered a love of indoor climbing through their daughter, who took an interest in the activity at a young age. Dissatisfied with the lack of climbing options in their area, they built a new facility and wanted an identity to match the rambunctious spirit of kids and the kids-at-heart."

        Working with the Ruckus team, I developed a moodboard to serve as a visual menu of ideas that we could draw on to develop a brand. Using this board, we created a list of qualities that we wanted to include:
        - **Dimension** &mdash; Depth in addition to width and height.
        - **Primitive forms** &mdash; Big basic shapes that look like something you can climb on.
        - **Rhythm** &mdash; A playful vibe that echoes the energy of a day of fun.
        - **Punchy colors** &mdash; Avoid primary colors and instead opt for more bold natural tones that can be mixed and matched and still work well together.

        Additionally, I did a competitive analysis of other climbing gyms in the state to see what we could learn from their identities. This took the form of a simple tier list, where I ranked other climbing gyms based on the quality of their logo concept and execution. (I would like to point out that my ranking is not an indictment of the facilities themselves.)
        
        This process immediately highlighted two tropes I wanted to avoid: literal depictions of *mountains* and *climbers.* Anything else was fair game.

### Process work
From there I experimented with cut-up paper shapes to develop type concepts, referenced handholds and volumes from actual climbing suppliers, and modeled shapes in Rhino 3D to ultimately shape a mark that combines a youthful spirit with a bold climbable structure.
In addition to creating the mark, I was also asked to make a small advertisement for use in a local publication announcing the gym's opening.
