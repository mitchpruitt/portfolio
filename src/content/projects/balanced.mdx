description: "Cycle Labs was a new company spun out of Tryon Solutions in order to seek external funding for their flagship product. The change involved a new brand and some new teammates, so Marketing asked if I could create a shirt for distribution at our first all-hands meeting under the new banner."

<ProjectSection sectionTitle="Approach">

        I began by considering the elements that made Cycle Labs stand out among other enterprise software companies: 
        - **Expertise** &mdash; Cycle Labs' employees accrued years worth of experience in fields including quality assurance, warehouse operations, and software development prior to joining the company, informing our market strategy and feature set.
        - **Cheerfulness** &mdash; While the organization was serious about delivering quality products and experiences, it was also dedicated to being a fun place to work. Teams were frequently invited to go-kart races, laser tag battles, and nights out on the town, which fostered cohesion and happiness.
        - **Authenticity** &mdash; Workers were encouraged to be their 'true selves'  to share their passions, ideas, and critiques openly, as well as receive them from others gracefully.

        Ultimately, Cycle Labs was an interesting place to work and I wanted to design a graphic that matched its energy while still highlighting the new brand. This meeting would also be the first time everyone would be in the same place at the same time following the onset of COVID-19. It was important to me that this shirt be light-hearted and enjoyable.
