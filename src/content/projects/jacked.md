description: "When local gym RipXFit wanted to start a new men's fitness class, owner Jean-Pierre said he already had a name in mind – Jacked – but needed something raw and powerful to serve as its mascot. Given the amount of lifting and hanging athletes perform in class, a gorilla seemed like a natural fit."

I started my process by using reference images of silverback gorillas, but was unimpressed with the rounded bon-bon skull shape I'd developed once I started rendering with vectors. Rather than focusing on a simplified icon, I attempted a more maximalist approach like you'd see in pro sports team logos — a gorilla with wild hair; protruding lip and teeth; and a furrowed brow. This approach had just the right amount of edge to serve as the face of a men's group strength class.
